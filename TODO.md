## TODO
* Handle bad zones in UI
* Change the gear icon to wrench, need an icon or font for this. Unicode wrench looks ugly.
* Fix location of the gear icon (margin on the right)
* Switch from sync storage to local, user might want to have different settings on different devices.
* Don't update text when not needed (time in current resolution didn't change).
* More CSS for settings page

## Next version
* Add simple calendar, maybe jQuery calendar widget
* Add auto completion for zones when typing them in
* Add buttons to sort East - West or West - East
