## TODO
* Simplify the scripts section in package.json, take out the list of files to copy into a separate file. (cpx, copyfiles)

## Next version
* Change the calendar left/right buttons to look nicer. Maybe with no png files (Try fa angle or chevron icons)
* Add auto completion/suggestions for zones when typing them in
* Add buttons to sort East - West or West - East
