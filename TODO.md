## TODO
* CSS for settings page
* Handle bad zones in UI
* Fix location of the gear icon (margin on the right)
* Change the gear icon to wrench, need an icon or font for this. Unicode wrench looks ugly.
* Switch from sync storage to local, user might want to have different settings on different devices.


## Next version
* Add simple calendar, maybe jQuery calendar widget
* Add auto completion for zones when typing them in
